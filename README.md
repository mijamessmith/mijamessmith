### Hi There, I'm Michael

### Thanks for swinging by. I'm a fullstack engineer living in the Bay Area working mostly in Node, React, and postgreSQL/MySQL + Mongo. 

### Before my engineering career I was a concert pianist and a fellow at Carnegie Hall/Juilliard. I earned a doctorate from Stony Brook University and travelled all over the world performing and finding the most dive-y restaurants in every city.
