### Hi There, I'm Michael   :wave:

Thanks for swinging by. I'm a fullstack engineer living in the Bay Area working mostly in Node, React, AWS, and SQL+noSQL. 

Before my engineering career I was a concert pianist and a fellow at Carnegie Hall/Juilliard. I earned a doctorate from Stony Brook University and travelled all over the world performing and finding the most dive-y restaurants in every city  :musical_score:  :fork_and_knife:.
